# NotHotdog
If you're familiar with HBO's Silicon Valley, you'll understand the reference for this project.  If not, it'll seem very random.  Either way, it's very stupid.  [NotHotdog](https://github.com/BrianPeek/NotHotdog) is an Azure Function that uses the Vision API in Cognitive Services to determine if a provide image contains a hotdog or not.

[![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://azuredeploy.net/?repository=https://github.com/BrianPeek/NotHotdog)

## Requirements
* An [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) account

## Links
* [NotHotdog Repo](https://github.com/BrianPeek/NotHotdog)

## What's It Do?
Give the Azure Function an image as a URL or POST the image data, and it will return the string **true** or **false**.  Simple!

You can see a demo below.

## Configuration
Setting this up is pretty simple.

### Computer Vision API
To use the Computer Vision API, you will need an endpoint and key.

#### Trial Key
* Browse to the [Cognitive Services API portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/), logging in if necessary.
* Select the Computer Vision API key.
* You will end up with an endpoint and 2 keys.  Copy these to a safe place.

#### Production Key
* Browse to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
* Create a new service
* Select Cognitive Services
* blah blah blah

### Azure Deployment
1. Click the [Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/?repository=https://github.com/BrianPeek/nothotdog) link here or the button above.
1. Enter the information for your Azure subscription, such as the resource group, location, etc. and give your site a unique Site Name.  This site name will become part of the URL.
1. Copy down the URL to your web application, which will be https://&lt;sitename&gt;.azurewebsites.net .

The application will be deployed and the GitHub repo above will be setup in the App Service as the deployment source.  We'll come back to the portal later to enter some keys that you will generate below.

### Azure Function Configuration
1. Browse back to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and login.
1. Open the App Service that you deployed above.
1. Click the **Application settings** entry in the **Settings** section in the left panel.
1. Add the following entries to the **App settings** section and then click the **Save** button:

Key | Value
----|------
MicrosoftAppId       | The App Id copied from the Bot Registration step [1]
MicrosoftAppPassword | The generated password copied from the Bot Registration step [2]
RedirectUri          | The OAuthCallback handler, which must match the URL you used when you created the OAuth Application on GitHub [3]
GitHubClientId       | The ID generated by GitHub when you created the OAuth Application [4]
GitHubClientSecret   | The secret generated by GitHub when you created the OAuth Application [4]
LuisModelId          | The ID genreated by LUIS.ai [5]
LuisSubscriptionKey  | The ID generated by LUIS.ai [6]

## How to Run
Head back to the [Bot Framework portal](https://dev.botframework.com/bots/) and click on the bot you just created.  Then, to interact with the bot:
* Click the Test button at the top right to communicate with the bot in your browser
* Click the Skype link to add the bot to your Skype contact list
* Add additional channels and communicate through those apps
* Type **help** at the bot to get more information, or **login** to log into GitHub with the bot.

## How it Works

## Next Steps
Here are links to the docs for the items discussed above.  Play around with the project and feel free to leave comments on the article, [open issues](https://github.com/BrianPeek/nothotdog/issues) in the repo, or submit [pull requests](https://github.com/BrianPeek/nothotdog/pulls) with fixes and new features.
